						<p class="text" >Well, my side of the story starts a little before Jeff's does.  For anyone that knows Laurier's campus, you will know how small our science program was.  Even if you didn't know everyone in the science program, you would be likely to recognize them... especially after 4 years at the school.</p>
						<p class="text" >So in the fall of 2009, I noticed this handsome guy starting to hang around the science building and since I had never seen him before I assumed he was a first year.  Then I saw his salt and pepper hair... "ok well maybe he's a prof" I thought. ;) hehehe</p>
						<p class="text" >Anyways, I kept seeing him around for a couple months.  One day I was studying with my friend in the science building and Jeff happened to walk passed our table.  I said to my friend, "that guy is so cute!" to which my friend replied "you mean Jeff? HEY JEFF! Come over here!" So as Jeff approached our table I blushed and got all giddy. </p>

						<p class="text" >As soon as he started talking, I knew Jeff was going to be someone I would definitely get along with!  We talked and joked around a bit and then he went back to sit at his table.  Funny enough, he was also sitting with another mutual friend we have.  She ended up putting our phone numbers in each other's phones and that night we started texting each other.  We started talking and hanging out every day after that and it felt like we had been best friends for years!  And as they say, the rest is history.</p>
						<p class="text" >We have been together ever since and I couldn't be happier to have found my soul mate.  In my whole life, I could've never imagined I would find someone as perfect for me as Jeff and I feel so honoured and excited to soon be his wife! :D</p>

					<p class="text">Making the decision to ask Nicole to be my wife was definitely an easy one to make for a number of reasons. She's always been the person who could lift my spirits during hard times. Spending time with her is always a treat as we both have the same common interests (yeah, we do play a lot of video games together...I know you're all thinking that). To top it off, after a year of dating my family was already asking "So when are you getting married?!". You can imagine my response at that time, but that soon changed to "So when are you guys having kids?!". Needless to say, I think Nicole passed the family approval test very early on.</p>
					<p class="text">After finding the ring, I started to think of ways to pop the question. There were so many idea's floating around my head like "what if I got the same room in Niagara that we spent our 6 month anniversary in?" to "a proposal at a Jays game would be so corny and cool!". Then talks started with my sister, Cindy, about taking a trip to Cuba. </p>
					</td></tr>
				</table>
				<table style="width:95%; margin: 0 auto;">
					<tr><td>
						<p class="text">Well, after a lot of debating about it I decided to drop all previous plans and came to the conclusion that Cuba would be an excellent place. Soon started the real planning. I originally wanted to ask Nicole's Dad for permission over a bucket of KFC, but time was running out and the trip was soon approaching! KFC was out, instead I resorted to a quick phone call with Nicole's parents, Elaine and Paul. I was terrified and I don't know why because Nicole's parents are wonderful, and once I got the words out of my mouth I could tell how excited they were through the phone. I definitely got the approval :).</p>
						<p class="text">My Mom was gracious enough to smuggle the ring into Cuba for me in her purse, but there was a bit of a scare going through customs at the airport. She had a bottle of formula in her purse for little Julia, which security needed to look into. As they began to search through the purse, I noticed Nicole getting closer to see what was going on. My heart was racing and all I could think of doing was jumping infront of Nicole and saying "Hey! Don't look through my Mom's stuff!". Crisis narrowly averted...</p>
						<p class="text">We're now in Cuba, it's night time and we're thinking of exploring the beach a little bit but we make a stop by my Mom's room first. My Mom runs the distraction while I sneak the ring into my pocket and then we're off for a nice walk. After Nicole got terrified from seeing a crab in the dark, it was time to get off the beach. I spotted a little wedding gazebo and we headed over to it. With my arms around her, I started to tell Nicole how much I loved her and how perfect together we were. She began to tell say how she loves how easy things are between us, but it didn't stop there. She kept talking. There was a little pause, so I thought of something else to say, but yet again Nicole stole the convo...</p>
						<p class="text">"Geez, she talks a lot" I thought to myself. Starting to wonder if I'd ever get the chance to ask, I decided that talking more wasn't likely the best idea anymore. There was silence and Nicole looked down to brush something off her shirt. When she looked back up, there it was, the ring in front of her eyes. It took her a second to realize what it was but then it hit her. "No way..." she said. "Noooo way. NO WAY. NOOOO WAY! No way". Oh please say something else, I thought to myself.</p>
						<p class="text">She turned around, and I got down on my knee and popped the question.</p>
